The discussion will\nalternate between theory and practice. The format will alternate between lecture\nand exercises. Please ask questions as soon as they arise in your mind. Please\nprovide feedback or voice concerns.\n\nThere are two additional sections:\n\n- [Chapter 5: Programming & Advanced Topics](05-programming.html) - Topics for\n  users who wish to move beyond the basics.\n- [Appendix](06-appendix.html) - Houses the exercise solutions.\n\n## Creation of this document {.unnumbered}\n\nThese notes are published using [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The Stata code is\nfirst rendered using a Stata [dynamic\ndocument](https://www.stata.com/manuals/rptdynamicdocumentsintro.pdf). The\nsource code for these notes can be found at\n<https://github.com/CSCAR/workshop-stata-intro> for the curious.\n\nAll images should link to full-size versions to see detail if needed.\n\nDark mode can be toggled on via the switch in the top left corner. Images are\ncolor-reversed in dark mode to avoid brightness; mouse over them (or click on\nmobile) to display originals.\n\n## Contact information {.unnumbered}\n\n### CSCAR {.unnumbered}\n\n<http://cscar.research.umich.edu/>\n\nCSCAR is available for free consultations with PhD statisticians (email\ndeskpeople@umich.edu to request a consultation).\n\nCSCAR also has GSRAs available for more immediate help.
