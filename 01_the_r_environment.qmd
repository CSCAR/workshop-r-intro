# The **[R]{.sans-serif}** *Environment*

**[R]{.sans-serif}** has been described as "an environment for
statistical modeling and graphics.\" The word *environment* instead of
*package* is one of the main reasons **[R]{.sans-serif}** is distinct
from other statistical programs. A *package* gives a user a fixed set of
tools. An *environment*, in addition to providing a fixed set of tools,
allows users to customize those existing tools and to develop their own
tools to suit their unique needs.

## Why Are There So Many Use**[R]{.sans-serif}**s?

These are some of the likely reasons you are here today.

### Statistical Tools

The **[R]{.sans-serif}** environment contains many powerful tools for
statistical analysis including

-   Linear and Generalized Linear Models

-   Survival Analysis

-   Random and Mixed Effects Models

-   Classification and Clustering

-   Sample Size and Power Calculations

-   Multivariable analysis (FA, PCA, SEM, ...)

In this workshop will see and use sample code for many of these
analyses.

### Graphics

Many researchers use **[R]{.sans-serif}** specifically for its excellent
graphing capabilities. Graphics in **[R]{.sans-serif}** are easy to
implement and modify. Once you are comfortable with
**[R]{.sans-serif}**, you will have several powerful graphics packages
at your fingertips. "Base graphics" has been supplemented by "grid
graphics" and the "grammar of graphics."

### Extensibility

Despite the extensive built-in statistical techniques, the most powerful
feature of **[R]{.sans-serif}** is the ability for users to extend
**[R]{.sans-serif}**'s base capabilities. **[R]{.sans-serif}** is a
full-fledged programming language that allows users to write their own
functions. Users can contribute their own "packages" that build on
**[R]{.sans-serif}**'s base capabilities. Users have contributed over
13,700 packages to CRAN (Comprehensive **[R]{.sans-serif}** Archive
Network) as of March 2019.

### Cost (\$0)

**[R]{.sans-serif}** is open source: the source code behind the software
is free for all to examine and extend. **[R]{.sans-serif}** grows by
leaps and bounds as people from all fields develop new functions for use
within **[R]{.sans-serif}**'s computing environment. This is part of
what makes **[R]{.sans-serif}** so useful. Many complex statistical
routines that not yet available in other statistical software systems
have been programmed in **[R]{.sans-serif}**, and these routines are
freely available for use by anyone.

### Operating Systems and GUIs

**[R]{.sans-serif}** runs on Windows, MacOS, and a variety of Unix
platforms. In Windows, there are at least four GUIs: the standard
**[R]{.sans-serif}** GUI, **[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio,
Tinn-**[R]{.sans-serif}**, and **[R]{.sans-serif}** Commander. We will
be using the standard **[R]{.sans-serif}** GUI some and
**[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio (`www.rstudio.com`) more. It organizes the
user's screen into panes that display programs/scripts, objects,
graphics, and the **[R]{.sans-serif}** console. **[R]{.sans-serif}**
Commander (`www.rcommander.com`), developed by John Fox at McMaster
University, is a front-end for interacting with **[R]{.sans-serif}**
through menus. This package can be useful to **[R]{.sans-serif}**
beginners. It provides helpful tools for getting started and then
displays the underlying **[R]{.sans-serif}** code for each analysis to
help the user learn the programming language. Tinn-**[R]{.sans-serif}**
(`sourceforge.net/projects/tinn-r/`) is another enhanced editor from
Jose Claudio Faria.

### Reproducible Research

**[R]{.sans-serif}** has several methods for integrating code, output,
and interpretation into a single document. This allows consumers to
confirm the original analysis and to investigate other approaches.

## Why Isn't Everyone a Use**[R]{.sans-serif}**?

### One and Only

Many users of statistics learn only one package: the one taught in their
first introductory statistics course. Historically this has rarely been
**[R]{.sans-serif}**, but there are signs this is changing.

### Steep Learning Curve

It can take time to get comfortable and productive with
**[R]{.sans-serif}**. A user often interacts with **[R]{.sans-serif}**
through typed commands, rather than via a point-and-click menu system.
For users with minimal background writing code, it can take some time to
get the hang of using **[R]{.sans-serif}**. Furthermore, while the help
system is comprehensive for the base packages, it's quality ranges for
community-written packages. Don't get frustrated! You don't have to be
an expert programmer to learn **[R]{.sans-serif}**. The benefits
(flexibility, extensibility, speed) are worth spending some time up
front.

## Suggestions for Learning **[R]{.sans-serif}**

-   Learn interactively! Reading can help only so much. Most people
    learn **[R]{.sans-serif}** best by typing commands themselves.

-   Ask questions of current **[R]{.sans-serif}** users, e.g., your
    instructor.

-   Look at (and retype) lots of sample code. Experiment with
    modifications of the code. You won't break **[R]{.sans-serif}**.
    You'll see many examples in this workshop but there is much more
    online.

-   Don't worry about getting errors. Experienced **[R]{.sans-serif}**
    users make errors all the time. Base **[R]{.sans-serif}** has
    excellent error messages that are good learning opportunities
    themselves.

        central webpage for the **[R]{.sans-serif}** project. Here you
        will find links for downloading **[R]{.sans-serif}**,
        downloading additional packages for **[R]{.sans-serif}**, and
        almost everything else that you would like to know about the
        software or the people behind it.

## How To Obtain **[R]{.sans-serif}**

**[R]{.sans-serif}** is already installed on the lab workstations. The
following information is useful if you need to install
**[R]{.sans-serif}** on another machine.

At the **[R]{.sans-serif}** Project Web Page (`www.r-project.org`) the
most important link is at the left hand side of the screen, under the
"Download" heading. Click on the CRAN link (Comprehensive
**[R]{.sans-serif}** Archive Network), and, after you choose one of the
U.S. mirrors, you will be taken to the page that you will use to
download everything **[R]{.sans-serif}**-related.

Once you find the CRAN web page, take the following steps to obtain
**[R]{.sans-serif}**:

1.  Click on "Download **[R]{.sans-serif}** for XXX" that best describes
    your operating system (Linux, OS X, Windows).

2.  When using Windows, click on the "base" subdirectory. This will
    allow you to download the base **[R]{.sans-serif}** packages.

3.  Click the "Download **[R]{.sans-serif}** 3.X.X for Windows" link.
    **[R]{.sans-serif}** is updated quite frequently. At the time of
    this printing, version 3.5.2 is available. Save the .exe file
    somewhere on your computer.

4.  Double-click on the .exe file once it has been downloaded. A wizard
    will appear that will guide you through the setup of the
    **[R]{.sans-serif}** software on your machine.

5.  Once you are finished, you should have an **[R]{.sans-serif}** icon
    on your desktop that gives you a shortcut to the
    **[R]{.sans-serif}** system. Double-click on this icon, and you are
    ready to go!

### How to Obtain RStudio

**[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio is already installed on the lab workstations.
The following information is useful if you need to install
**[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio on another machine.

Visit (`www.rstudio.com`) and download the free desktop version of
**[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio.

### Contributed Packages

What exactly are "additional contributed packages"? **[R]{.sans-serif}**
is an open source software environment, so users are free to explore the
code behind the software and to write their own new code. Statisticians,
researchers, and other users have written additional packages for
**[R]{.sans-serif}** that perform complex analyses (and simple ones!).
In order to use these packages and the functions within them, you first
need to download them. Base **[R]{.sans-serif}** comprises many
packages, but odds are that you will discover an uncommon analysis
technique in your research that requires you to install an additional
package that is not included by default.

These additional packages are usually found CRAN. However, there are
other repositories as well (e.g., bioconductor, github).
