# Getting Started with R

## The RStudio interface

The first screen we see in R should look like this:

[![The first screen we see when we open RStudio](./images/rstudio_first_screen.jpg)](./images/rstudio_first_screen.jpg)

Here, there are three main window panes. The "Console" window is where we type the code to tell the computer to do stuff.

The "Environment-History-Connections" window has three tabs. "Environment" 
shows the objects that we have saved during our session (I will explain this 
soon); "History" shows a record of all the code we asked the computer to run; and "Connections"—which we will not use here—shows we the connections we have to remote databases.

The "Files-Plots-Packages" window has several tabs. "Files" shows us all the 
files in our current working directory, which is the default location where R 
will look for files we want to load and where it will put any files we save. 
"Plots" will display the plots we make in R. "Packages" shows us the packages 
installed in our computer and whether they are loaded in our current session. 
"Help" allows us to search and read the documentation for packages and 
functions. "Viewer" can display content that usually belongs to a web browser 
(i.e., html files).

We can tell **[R]{.sans-serif}** to do stuff by typing *commands* in the line that begins with `>` in the  console window. This line is called "command prompt". Let's begin with something simple:

```{r simplest operation}
1 + 1
```

The `[1]` that appears next to the result informs us that the line begins with the first value in the result. This information is helpful when we run commands that produce multiple values, like in this case:

```{r quick sequence of numbers}
80:110
```

If we type an incomplete command, R will assume that we are still writing and 
will show a `+`. This `+` is *not* an arithmetical operator; it's a prompt for us to continue writing in the next line. The prompt will not go away unless we complete the command or we press the "Escape" key. For example:

```{r}
#| eval: false
> 42 -
+
+
+ 1
[1] 41
```

If R does not understand a command, it will display an error message.

```{r}
#| eval: false
> 7 % 2
Error: unexpected input in "7 % 2"
>
```

## Using R as a Calculator

**[R]{.sans-serif}** can perform basic arithmetic operations. Type the
following expressions at the command prompt (the line that begins with `>`) in
the **[R]{.sans-serif}** console window.

```{r simple arithmetic}
5 + 3
5 - 3
5*3
5/3
```

**[R]{.sans-serif}** can also do exponentiation with `^` or `**`; modulus, also known as remainder from division, with `%%`; and integer division with `%/%`.

If we try to do shoddy math, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will inform us (but not necessarily with an error message):

```{r shoddy math}
#| error: true
0/0
-1/0
```

**[R]{.sans-serif}** also has logical operators that will return "TRUE" or
"FALSE".

```{r logical operators}
5 == 6
5 != 6
5 < 6
```


**[R]{.sans-serif}** has "and" (`&`) and "or" (`|`) operators to combine multiple logical statements:

```{r conjunction and disjunction}
(5 < 6) & (7 == 8)
(5 < 6) | (7 == 8)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Practice

Think of an integer, double it, add six, divide it in half, subtract the number you started with, and then square it. If your code is correct, the answer should be nine.
:::

**Be careful of comparisons and floating point arithmetic**:

```{r floating point arithmetic}
(.1 + .2) == .3
(.1 + .2) - .3
```

<!--
The `all.equal` function will test if two values are "close enough":

`> all.equal(5, sqrt(5)^2)`

`> ?all.equal`
-->

This is not **[R]{.sans-serif}**'s fault. All computers have a limited space to 
store numbers and decimal positions. So, computers often use numbers with 
"hidden" decimals even when it looks like they use round numbers. For example, 
what we think of as `3` may actually be `3.000005`. This is common enough to justify the **[R]{.sans-serif}** [FAQ (7.31)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f). To quote from "The Elements of Programming Style", 
by Kernighan and Plauger: "10.0 times 0.1 is hardly ever 1.0."

Being able to do these computations is good and all, but what happens if we want to use a result later without redoing the computation? **[R]{.sans-serif}** can save numbers (and more) using something called "objects".

## Objects

In simple terms, an object is a named piece of information. A single number, a word, a plot, and a set of instructions can all be objects if we name them. The name allows us to access the piece of information whenever we want. To create an object, we must first choose a name, then type an arrow `<-` (a "lower than" symbol `<` followed by a "minus" sign `-`), and then write the value that we want to save.

```{r create first object}
my_object <- 42
```

Another way of creating the object is to use the "equal to" sign `=` instead of the arrow.

```{r create first object method 2}
my_object = 42
```

In this context, both `<-` and `=` are acting as "assignment operators" because they assign the value `42` to the name `my_object`. In **[R]{.sans-serif}**, `=` has several uses, so if you want to avoid confusion, I suggest you use `<-`. But you can pick whichever symbol you like the most as long as you are consistent.

Now the environment window shows that there is an object called `my_object`, which we can access at anytime by typing its name.

```{r call my_object}
my_object
```

[![The environment pane with an object](./images/environment_with_object.jpg)](./images/environment_with_object.jpg)

`my_object` has a number as its value, so we can do mathematical operations with it.

```{r}
my_object + 7
my_object**my_object
```

We can also create objects based on other objects.

```{r}
a <- 10
b <- a
a
b
```

Be careful with names. If we try to reuse a name, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will overwrite the previous object without notifying us in any way.

```{r overwriting object}
c <- 2
c
c <- 711
c
```

However, if an object was the copy of another object, overwriting the original object does not affect the copy:

```{r}
a <- 10
b <- a
b
a <- 5
b
```

We can use almost any name we want, but there are a few rules:

+ Names can be a combination of letters, digits, period `.` and underscore `_`.
+ Names can *not* include white spaces.
+ If a name starts with a period `.`, it can *not* be followed by a digit.
+ Names can *not* start with a number or an underscore `_`.
+ Names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables).
+ Reserved words can *not* be used as variables (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `if`, ...).

There are also a few suggestions that will save you many hours of frustration:

+ Avoid giving your object the same name as a built-in function.
+ If you need to create objects with multiple words in their name, separate them with [an underscore] (`my_value`) or a dot (`my.value`), or capitalize the different words (`MyValue`). I like the underscore format (called [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) naming). You can use whichever one you want. Just be consistent.
+ Use informative names. It is quick and easy to use names like `x` or `my_value`. But your code will be easier and faster to understand if your objects have names that illustrate what you want to do with them. Your colleagues and your future self will really appreciate it.

## Using functions

**[R]{.sans-serif}** has many built-in functions for anything from basic math to text manipulation to advanced statistical models. Functions are also objects in **[R]{.sans-serif}**. But instead of storing a single number as we did before, functions store commands that we can apply to an input. For example, we can round a number, calculate its square root, its factorial, or its natural logarithm. To use a function, we must write the name of a function followed by the data we want it to use inside a pair of round brackets.

```{r simple mathematical functions}
#| results: hide
round(2.1415)
sqrt(9)
factorial(7)
log(100)
```

The information inside the round brackets is called an "argument". `sqrt()` and `factorial()` only use one argument (the number that we want to use). But other functions---like `round()` and `log()`---can take more arguments to modify their behavior. For example, in `round()`, the first argument corresponds to the number we want to round, and the second argument corresponds to the number of decimal places that we want to keep. The arguments are separated by commas.

```{r rounding to different decimal places}
round(2.1415, 0)
round(2.1415, 2)
```

The order of the arguments is important. What happens if we try to run `round(2, 2.1415)`? Fortunately, arguments have names that you can use to specify which data to use in each case. So, we can write

```{r naming arguments}
round(x = 2.1415, digits = 3)
```

Even better, we can pass arguments in any order as long as we name them all

```{r}
round(digits = 3, x = 2.1415)
```

But if we use the wrong name in a function, we will probably get an error message

```{r}
#| error: true
round(x = 2.1415, basket = 3)
```

A quick way to check what arguments we can use is to use another function called `args()`, which takes the name of a function as its argument:

```{r}
args(round)
```

The output shows that `round()` has two arguments: `x` (the number we want to round) and `digits`. It also shows that `digits` is already set to zero. This means that **[R]{.sans-serif}** will use `0` as the default value. Arguments with default values are optional because we can choose to modify them or not.

I encourage you to name all the arguments in the function, or at least the ones after the first argument. It is hard to remember all the arguments that can go into more complicated functions. And it is even harder to remember the correct order. Accidentally switching unnamed arguments can produce wrong results without us knowing. Naming the arguments will prevent errors and clarify the function's behavior.

We can also use functions inside other functions

```{r nested function}
sqrt(round(16.483, digits = 0))
```

R first runs the innermost function and then uses the result in the outermost function to get the final result.

The functions we have used are simple and intuitive to use. But sometimes we need to know more before we can use a function in our code. Where can we find explanations to help us?

## Getting help

To access R’s built-in help information on any function simply use the `help()` function. For example, to open the help page for `round()`, we do

```{r help function}
#| eval: false
help("round")
```

A shorter way of writing this is to use `?` before the name of the function.

```{r help shortcut}
#| eval: false
?round
```

After you run the code, the help page is displayed in the "Help" tab in the "Files-Plots-Packages" pane (usually in the bottom right of **[R]{.sans-serif}**Studio).

As a novice user, help pages may seem arcane, probably because they aim for shortness and use a lot of technical jargon. But this short jargon makes (most of) the explanations precise, so we can use the information we need without having to read the entire document. Also, all help pages are organized similarly, so we don't have to relearn how to navigate them. So, with a bit of practice, you will be able to find exactly what you need in mere seconds.

The first line of the help document displays the name of the function and the package that contains the function. Other sections are:

+ **Description**: a short description of the function.

+ **Usage**: names the arguments associated with the function and possible default values.

+ **Arguments**: expounds each argument and what they do.

+ **Details**: a more detailed description of the function.

+ **Value**: if applicable, gives the type and structure of the object returned by the function or the operator.

+ **See Also**: leads to other help pages with similar or related content.

+ **Examples**: code examples on how to use the function. To see how they work, we just need to copy and paste them into the console. We can also access examples at any time by using the `example()` function (e.g., `example("round")`).

The `help()` function is useful if we know the name of the function. But if all we remember is a key word in the name, we can search through **[R]{.sans-serif}**'s help system using `help.search()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
help.search("round")
```

Or we can use the shortcut `??`

```{r}
#| eval: false
??round
```

As before, the 'Help' tab in RStudio will display the results of the search. `help.search()` searches through the help documentation, code demonstrations, and package vignettes and displays the results as clickable links that we can follow.

Another useful function is `apropos()`, which lists all functions containing a specified character string. For example, to find all functions with `sum` in their name, we use

```{r}
apropos("round")
```

Note that `apropos()` returns names even when the word we used is only part of a larger word, like in "surround".

If we find the function we need, we can look for its documentation.

```{r}
#| eval: false
help("round.Date")
```

Another useful function is `RSiteSearch()`, which allows us to search for keywords and phrases in function help pages and vignettes for *all* CRAN packages, and in CRAN task views. This way we can access the [online search engine](https://www.r-project.org/search.html) directly from the Console and display the results in our web browser.

```{r}
#| eval: false
RSiteSearch("regression")
```

:::callout-tip
## How to get started with help pages?
Start by reading the help pages of functions that you already understand. This will teach you how to understand the structure of the pages and will familiarize you with the jargon. As you use **[R]{.sans-serif}** you will likely need other, more complicated functions, so reading more help pages will happen almost naturally.

Just keep in mind that help pages are about code, not about the underlying concepts. If you don't know what it means to round a number, reading the documentation for `round()` will not help you.
:::

Now that we know how to get help, we can move on to more advanced stuff. Previously we worked with one number at the time. But we can also work with groups of numbers (and of other stuff) by using something called "vectors".

## Working with vectors

In **[R]{.sans-serif}**, an ordered group of numbers is called a vector. To create a vector of numbers, we need to use the function `c()` (short for "combine"). The arguments of `c()` are the numbers you want to use in the vector, in the order you want to use them.

```{r first vector}
my_vec <- c(5, 3, 7, 1, 1, 8)
my_vec
```

Vectors can also contain other types of data, like words:

```{r vector of names}
vector_of_words <- c("monday", "lemon")
vector_of_words
```

Note that we must enclose words in quotation marks to let **[R]{.sans-serif}** know that we want to use "monday" and "lemon" as values instead of the names of objects. Look at what happens if we forget the quotation marks:

```{r}
#| error: true
vector_of_words <- c(monday, lemon)
```

Later on we will work more with vectors of words, but for now let's focus on numerical vectors.

### Operations with numerical vectors

**[R]{.sans-serif}** is a "vectorized" language, which means that it can often operate on an entire vector of numbers as easily as on a single number. All the logical and mathematical functions we used before work with vectors:

```{r simple math with vectors}
my_vec / 11
my_vec <= 7
log(my_vec)
my_vec*my_vec
```

In the last example, **[R]{.sans-serif}** did not follow the rules of linear algebra to multiply two vectors. Instead, **[R]{.sans-serif}** used "element-wise execution", which means that **[R]{.sans-serif}** applied the same operation to each member of the vector. For example, `my_vec + 7` adds `7` to each number inside `my_vec`.

When you use two vectors with the same number of elements for an operation, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will line up the vectors and perform a sequence of individual operations. For instance, in `my_vec*my_vec`, **[R]{.sans-serif}** multiplies the first element of vector 1 by the first element of vector 2, then the second element of vector 1 by the second element of vector 2, and so on, until all elements are multiplied. The result will be a new vector the same length as the first two.

If you give **[R]{.sans-serif}** two vectors of unequal lengths, it will repeat the shorter vector until it is as long as the longer vector, and then do the math. 

```{r recycling vectors 1}
my_vec * c(1, 2)
```

If the length of the short vector does not divide evenly into the length of the long vector, R will do an incomplete repeat of the shorter vector and return a warning. 

```{r recycling vectors 2}
my_vec * c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

Repeating the numbers of the vector is known as "vector recycling", and it helps R do element-wise operations.

Element-wise operations allow us to manipulate entire data variables rather than 
one element at a time. When you start working with data sets, element-wise 
operations will ensure that values from one observation or case are only paired 
with values from the same observation or case. Element-wise operations also make
it easier to write your own programs and functions in R.

**[R]{.sans-serif}** can also do vector and matrix multiplications, but we have to explicitly ask for them. For example, to get the inner product, we need the operator `%*%`. And to get the outer product, we need `%o%`. If you are not familiar with matrix operations, don't worry. You won't need them in these notes.

### Extracting elements

We can access specific elements of vectors using the square bracket `[ ]` notation. Write the name of the vector you want to extract from, followed by the square brackets with an index of the element you wish to extract. This index can be a position or the result of a logical test.

To extract elements based on their position we simply write the position inside the `[ ]`. To extract the 3rd value of `my_vec`, we use

```{r extract value from my_vec}
my_vec[3]
```

We can store this value in another object

```{r}
value_3 = my_vec[3]
```

And we can extract multiple elements at the time by using a vector of indices inside the square brackets:

```{r}
my_vec[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

Or we can use `:` notation. Remember that `:` helps us create a sequence of values. For example,

```{r}
3:6
```

So,

```{r}
my_vec[3:6]
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Note 
In **[R]{.sans-serif}**, the positional index starts at 1, so to call the first element of a vector we need to use `[1]`. In most other programming languages (like Python and C++), the positional index starts at 0.
:::

Another convenient way to extract elements from a vector is to use a logical expression as an index. For example, to extract all elements greater than 4 from `my_vec`, we do

```{r}
my_vec[my_vec > 4]
```

This works because **[R]{.sans-serif}** uses element-wise operations even for logical statements. So, `my_vec > 4` asks if each item of `my_vec` meets the condition "greater than four" and returns the corresponding vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Then, when we add this result to the square brackets, **[R]{.sans-serif}** examines each element of `my_vec` asking "should I extract this element?". If the answer is `TRUE`, the value is extracted; if it's `FALSE`, the value is ignored. Under the hood, `my_vec > 4` is equivalent to

```{r}
my_vec[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Two useful functions to extract values of a vector are `head()`, which extracts the first few values of a vector; and `tail()`, which gives us the last few values of a vector. Try them yourself!

### Replacing elements

We can replace the elements of a vector by combining the square bracket notation with the assignment operator. For example, to replace the second element of `my_vec`, we do

```{r replace element}
my_vec[2] <- 99
my_vec
```

To replace multiple elements with the same value, say, elements 5 and 6, we do

```{r}
my_vec[c(5, 6)] <- 55
my_vec
```

**[R]{.sans-serif}** can also replace elements with an element wise operation:

```{r}
my_vec[c(5, 6)] <- c(100, 200)
my_vec
```

What happens if you try to replace two values with a vector that has three (or more) values?

Logical expressions help us replace values that meet specific conditions without having to find them ourselves.

```{r}
my_vec[my_vec > 44] <- -1
my_vec
```

### Reordering elements of vectors

To sort the elements of a vector from lowest to highest, we can use `sort()`

```{r}
my_vec <- sort(my_vec)
my_vec
```

If we want to sort from highest to lowest, we need to set the optional argument `decreasing` to `TRUE`

```{r}
my_vec <- sort(my_vec, decreasing = TRUE)
my_vec
```

Another option is to first use `sort()` and then reverse the sorted vector using `rev()`.

```{r}
my_vec <- rev(sort(my_vec))
```

A more useful feature of vectors is that we can reorder their elements based on the values of other vectors. To show this, let's first create a vector of countries and another vector with (my guess of) their typical daily temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}
countries <- c("Japan", "Egypt", "Mexico", "Finland")
temperatures_fahrenheit <- c(50, 90, 65, -10)
```

Now imagine we want to order the vector of countries, going from coldest to hottest. The first step to reorder the countries is to use `order()` to create a new variable called "temperatures_ordered".

```{r}
temperatures_ordered <- order(temperatures_fahrenheit)
temperatures_ordered
```

This output says that the lowest value in `temperatures_fahrenheit` is in the fourth position, the second lowest value is on the first position, and so on. So, we can think of `temperatures_ordered` as a vector of positional indices of temperatures in ascending order. Now we can use these indices to reorder the vector of countries.

```{r}
countries_ordered <- countries[temperatures_ordered]
countries_ordered
```

Ta-da!

These vector manipulations can do more than dazzle your friends. Imagine you have a dataset with two columns of data and you want to sort each column. If you just use `sort()` on each column separately, the values of each column will become uncoupled from each other. By using `order()` on one column, a vector of positional indices is created of the values of the column in ascending order. Then we can use this vector as the index of elements on the second column, which will return a vector of values based on the first column.

Until now, the console satisfied all our coding needs. But if we wanted to reuse a command from before, we would have to either rewrite it from scratch, or look through our command history (in the "Environment-History-Connections" window)---a tedious task. Besides, once we close this session in RStudio, all of our work will be gone, like tears in the rain. It would be much better if we wrote our code in a place where we can easily review and modify it.

## Working with scripts

An **[R]{.sans-serif}** script is a plain text file that we can use to save our code. I think the best way to code in **[R]{.sans-serif}** is to use a script, and I strongly suggest you always use one. A script helps us edit, proofread and reuse our code. It also allows us to save our code so we can share it with others or come back to it later. Also, it is cumbersome to write multi-line code in the console, but it is easy if we use a script.

To open a script, click on `File > New File > R script` in the menu bar on the upper left-hand side of the screen.

[![A screen with a new script](./images/new_script_screen.jpg)](./images/new_script_screen.jpg)

We can run a line of code using the `Run` button. **[R]{.sans-serif}** will run whichever line of code your cursor is on. We can also run all of the code in the script by clicking the `Source` button that's next to `Run`. I find that clicking buttons is slow, so I use a keyboard shortcut for running a line of code: `Control + Enter` in Windows and Linux; `Command + Enter` in Mac.

[![Buttons for running code](./images/run_code_buttons_edited.jpg)](./images/run_code_buttons_edited.jpg)

To save your script, you can click on the blue square^[Young reader, this square is a [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk); not-so-young reader, I feel your pain.] right below the tab with the script name. The first time you save your script, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will ask you to choose a name and a location to save your file in. I strongly suggest that you pick a name and and a location that you will remember easily in the future.

Moving forward, I will write all my code in a script and will assume you are doing so too. Trust me, it's for your own benefit.

Now that we know how to preserve our hard-obtained code, we can start doing more elaborate work. For example, if **[R]{.sans-serif}** doesn't have a pre-made function to do what we need, we can write one ourselves and test it easily using a script.

## Writing our own functions

Functions, as you may remember, are objects that store commands. The three basic parts of a function are name, code to implement, and arguments. To assemble these parts, we can use the `function()` function (yes, really) followed by a pair of curly brackets `{}`:

```{r}
my_function <- function() {}
```

`function()` will run the code that we write inside the curly brackets. This code is called the body of the function.

Let's try something simple, like adding 1 + 1:

```{r make simple_function}
simple_function <- function() {
    1 + 1
}
```

:::callout-tip
## Indents make code more readable
Note that I indented the body of the function. This indentation doesn't affect our function, but it lets the reader know that the code is only supposed to run inside the function.
:::

To run our function, we have to write its name followed by round brackets, just like with any other function:

```{r run simple function}
simple_function()
```

Remember to write the round brackets even if they are empty. The round brackets make R *run* the code inside the function. If we don't write these brackets, R will *show us* the code inside the function (try it!).

Now let's write a function that will convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius. Since we want to use this function with different temperatures, we need to include an argument that will tell **[R]{.sans-serif}** which temperature to convert each time.

```{r fahrenheit to celsius without function}
fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(temperature) {
    (temperature - 32) / 1.8
}
fahrenheit_to_celsius(27)
```

Now let's try something a bit more complicated: solving a quadratic equation. If we have an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then the solutions are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. We can write a function that will apply this formula for us.

```{r solve_quadratic incomplete}
solve_quadratic = function(a, b, c) {
    # Quadratic equations can have two solutions
    solution_1 = (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # First solution to equation
    solution_2 = (-b - sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # Second solution to equation
}
```

Did you see the comments I added? **[R]{.sans-serif}** will ignore everything that comes after a hashtag `#`. This `#` is known in **[R]{.sans-serif}** as *commenting symbol* because it allows us to comment our code. This way we can explain confusing chunks of code, or warn about potential problems.

Now all we need is to identify values of $a, b,$ and $c$ to pass as arguments.

```{r}
solve_quadratic(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)
```

Why didn't our function show a result? When we run a function, **[R]{.sans-serif}** runs the code in the body and returns the result of the last line of code. If this line doesn't return a value, neither will our function. So, we have to write something to ensure that `solve_quadratic()` displays the solutions. Since we are using a script (right?) it is easy to go back to our function and just add one more line:

```{r solve_quadratic}
solve_quadratic = function(a, b, c) {
    # Quadratic equations can have two solutions
    solution_1 = (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # First solution to equation
    solution_2 = (-b - sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # Second solution to equation
    c(solution_1, solution_2) # Show vector of solutions
}
solve_quadratic(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)
```

Our function can have as many arguments as we like. It is enough to add their names, separated by commas, in the parentheses that follow the function. When the function runs, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will replace each argument name in the function body with the corresponding value that we supply. If we don't supply a value, **[R]{.sans-serif}** will replace the argument name with the argument's default value (if we defined one).

Now imagine that we want to multiply the solutions to our equation by an arbitrary value (maybe because we want to convert the units of $x$ to something else). And let's pretend that, by default, we want to double the solutions. We can write another function that first calls `solve_quadratic()` and then multiplies the result by our arbitrary number.

```{r}
multiply_solutions = function(a, b, c, multiplier = 2) {
    solve_quadratic(a, b, c) * multiplier
}
multiply_solutions(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)
multiply_solutions(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3, multiplier = 10)
```

## Objects created in functions disappear
All of the objects that we create inside a function will disappear after it finishes running. We can only save the output of the function by assigning it to an object.

## Acquiring external packages

We don't need to reinvent the wheel every time we need to do something that is not available in **R**'s default version. We can easily download packages from CRAN's online repositories to get many useful functions.

To install a package from CRAN, we can use the `install.packages()` function. For example, if we wanted to install the package `readxl` (for loading .xslx files), we would need:
```{r installing readxl}
#| eval: false
install.packages("readxl", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The argument `dependencies` tells **R** whether it should also download other packages that `readxl` needs to work.

**R** may ask you to select a CRAN mirror, which simply put refers to the location of the servers you want to download from. Choose a mirror close to where you are.

After installing a package, we need to load it into **R** before we can use its functions. To load the package `readxl`, we need to use the function `library()`, which will also load any other packages required to load `readxl` and may print additional information.
```{r loading readxl}
#| eval: false
library("readxl")
```

Every time we start a new **R** session we need to load the packages we need. If we try to run a function without loading its package first, we will get an error message saying that **R** could not find it. 

Writing all our `library()` statements at the top of our **R** scripts is almost always a good idea. This helps us know that we need to load the libraries at the start our sessions; and it helps others know quickly that they will need to have those libraries installed to be able to use our code.

Sometimes only need one or two functions from a library. To avoid loading the entire library, we can access the specific function directly by specifying the package name followed by two colons and then the function name. For example:
```{r using specific function from library}
#| eval: false
readxl::read_xlsx("fake_data_file.xlsx")
```


## Exercise

Let's try to practice all of the basic features of **[R]{.sans-serif}** that you just learned.

Write a function that can simulate the roll of a pair of six-sided dice (let's call them red and blue) an arbitrary number of times. This function should return a vector with the values of the red die that were strictly larger than the corresponding values of the blue die. Hint: to simulate rolling a die, you can use the function `sample()`.
