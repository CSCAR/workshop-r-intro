    "text": "1.1 Why becoming a useR?\n\n1.1.1 Price ($0) and availability\nR is free—as in “no money required”—and it runs on Windows, MacOS, and several Unix platforms.\n\n\n1.1.2 Easy and cool graphics\nWith R, you can make basic scatter plots or histograms with one or two lines of code (assuming your data has a nice format). And you can use the “grammar of graphics” to make incremental changes: add custom colors, change the size of the plot or its contents, or arrange several graphics in grids.\n\n\n1.1.3 Abundant statistical tools\nR offers many powerful tools to fit statistical models (both bayesian and frequentist), including:\n\nLinear and Generalized Linear Models\nSurvival analysis\nTime series analysis\nRandom and Mixed Effects Models (aka hierarchical models, aka multilevel models)\nClassification and Clustering\nSample Size and Power Calculations\nMultivariable analysis (FA, PCA, SEM, …)\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Constant expansion\nNew tools become available in R all the time. R is a full-fledged programming language that allows users to write their own functions. Also, all of R’s code is open source, which means that everyone can examine it and contribute to it. So, users constantly publish their own “packages” (ready-to-use tools), which expand R’s base capabilities. As of March 2019, users have contributed over 13,700 packages to Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Many of these packages perform complex statistical routines that are not (and may never be) available in other statistical software systems.\n\n\n1.1.5 Flexible interfaces\nIn Windows, there are several ways to use R. The standard R graphical unit interface (GUI) allows you to point and click to do many basic tasks. Another GUI is R Commander, developed by John Fox at McMaster University. R Commander displays the underlying R code for each analysis to help the user learn the programming language. Tinn-R is another GUI from Jose Claudio Faria.\nThese GUIs are friendly and easy to grasp if you’re a beginner. But to use all of R’s capabilities you will need to do more than point and click.\nA more complete way of using R is through an integrated development environment (IDE), which, in short, helps you code. The most popular IDE for R is RStudio, which organizes the user’s screen into panes that display scripts, objects, graphics, and the R console.\nIn these notes, we will use RStudio a lot. The goal is for you to start taking full advantage of R’s capabilities."

In the past, R was almost never this first language, but nowadays many schools are teaching how to use it.\n\n\n1.2.2 Hard to learn\nIt can take time to get comfortable and productive with R, especially if you have little coding experience. Typing commands explicitly is more difficult than pointing and clicking. Also, each package has its own rules to learn. You can find a lot of good help for popular packages written by professional developers, but not so much for smaller packages written by other common users. Worst of all, some of the messages R displays if you make a mistake are uninformative, so figuring out what went wrong can be difficult.\nBut don’t get frustrated! You don’t have to be an expert programmer to use R. The benefits are worth spending some time up front."

Statisticians, researchers, and other users have written additional packages for R that perform complex analyses (and simple ones!). In order to use these packages and the functions within them, you first need to download them. Base R comprises many packages, but odds are that you will discover an uncommon analysis technique in your research that requires you to install an additional package that is not included by default.\nThese additional packages are usually found CRAN. However, there are other repositories as well (e.g., bioconductor, github)."

    "text": "2.1 The RStudio interface\nThe first screen we see in R should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe first screen we see when we open RStudio\n\n\nHere, there are three main window panes. The “Console” window is where we type the code to tell the computer to do stuff.\nThe “Environment-History-Connections” window has three tabs. “Environment” shows the objects that we have saved during our session (I will explain this soon); “History” shows a record of all the code we asked the computer to run; and “Connections”—which we will not use here—shows we the connections we have to remote databases.\nThe “Files-Plots-Packages” window has several tabs. “Files” shows us all the files in our current working directory, which is the default location where R will look for files we want to load and where it will put any files we save. “Plots” will display the plots we make in R. “Packages” shows us the packages installed in our computer and whether they are loaded in our current session. “Help” allows us to search and read the documentation for packages and functions. “Viewer” can display content that usually belongs to a web browser (i.e., html files).\nWe can tell R to do stuff by typing commands in the line that begins with &gt; in the console window. This line is called “command prompt”. Let’s begin with something simple:\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThe [1] that appears next to the result informs us that the line begins with the first value in the result. This information is helpful when we run commands that produce multiple values, like in this case:\n\n80:110\n\n [1]  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98\n[20]  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110\n\n\nIf we type an incomplete command, R will assume that we are still writing and will show a +. This + is not an arithmetical operator; it’s a prompt for us to continue writing in the next line. The prompt will not go away unless we complete the command or we press the “Escape” key. For example:\n\n&gt; 42 -\n+\n+\n+ 1\n[1] 41\n\nIf R does not understand a command, it will display an error message.\n\n&gt; 7 % 2\nError: unexpected input in \"7 % 2\"\n&gt;"

All computers have a limited space to store numbers and decimal positions. So, computers often use numbers with “hidden” decimals even when it looks like they use round numbers. For example, what we think of as 3 may actually be 3.000005. This is common enough to make the R FAQ (7.31). To quote from “The Elements of Programming Style”, by Kernighan and Plauger: “10.0 times 0.1 is hardly ever 1.0.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n\n\n\nThink of an integer, double it, add six, divide it in half, subtract the number you started with, and then square it. If your code is correct, the answer should be nine.\n\n\nBeing able to do these computations is good and all, but what happens if we want to use a result later without redoing the computation? R can save numbers (and more) using something called “objects”."

    "section": "2.3 Objects",
    "text": "2.3 Objects\nIn simple terms, an object is a named piece of information. A single number, a word, a plot, and a set of instructions can all be objects if we name them. The name allows us to access the piece of information whenever we want. To create an object, we must first choose a name, then type an arrow &lt;- (a “lower than” symbol &lt; followed by a “minus” sign -), and then write the value that we want to save.\n\nmy_object &lt;- 42\n\nAnother way of creating the object is to use the “equal to” sign = instead of the arrow.\n\nmy_object = 42\n\nIn this context, both &lt;- and = are acting as “assignment operators” because they assign the value 42 to the name my_object. In R, = has several uses, so if you want to avoid confusion, I suggest you use &lt;-. But as long as you are consistent, you can pick whichever symbol you like the most.\nNow the environment window shows that there is an object called my_object, which we can access at anytime by typing its name.\n\nmy_object\n\n[1] 42\n\n\nAnd because my_object has a number as its value, we can do mathematical operations with it.\n\nmy_object + 7\n\n[1] 49\n\nmy_object/11\n\n[1] 3.818182\n\nmy_object**my_object\n\n[1] 1.501309e+68\n\n\nWe can also create objects based on other objects.\n\na &lt;- 10\nb &lt;- a\na\n\n[1] 10\n\nb\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nBe careful with names. If we try to reuse a name, R will overwrite the previous object without notifying us in any way.\n\nc &lt;- 2\nc\n\n[1] 2\n\nc &lt;- 711\nc\n\n[1] 711\n\n\nHowever, if an object was the copy of another object, overwriting the original object does not affect the copy:\n\na &lt;- 10\nb &lt;- a\nb\n\n[1] 10\n\na &lt;- 5\nb\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nWe can use almost any name we want, but there are a few rules:\n\nNames can be a combination of letters, digits, period . and underscore _.\nIf a name starts with a period ., it can not be followed by a digit.\nNames can not start with a number or an underscore _.\nNames are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\nReserved words can not be used as variables (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, if, …).\nNames can not include white spaces.\n\nThere are also a few suggestions that will save you many hours of frustration:\n\nIt’s never a good idea to give your object the same name as a built-in function.\nIf you need to create objects with multiple words in their name, separate them with an underscore (my_value) or a dot (my.value), or capitalize the different words (MyValue). I like the underscore format (called snake case naming). You can use whichever one you want. Just be consistent.\nUse informative names. It is quick and easy to use names like x or my_value. But your code will be easier and faster to understand if your objects have names that illustrate what you want to do with them. Your colleagues and your future self will really appreciate it."

    "section": "2.4 Using functions",
    "text": "2.4 Using functions\nR has many built-in functions for anything from basic math to advanced statistical models. Functions are also objects in R. But instead of storing a single number as we did before, functions store commands that we can apply to an input. For example, we can round a number, calculate its square root, its factorial, or its natural logarithm. To use a function, we must write the name of a function followed by the data we want it to use inside a pair of round brackets.\n\nround(2.1415)\n\n[1] 2\n\nsqrt(9)\n\n[1] 3\n\nfactorial(7)\n\n[1] 5040\n\nlog(100)\n\n[1] 4.60517\n\n\nThe information inside the round brackets is called an “argument”. sqrt() and factorial() only use one argument (the number that we want to use). But other functions—like round() and log()—can take more arguments to modify their behavior. For example, in round(), the first argument corresponds to the number we want to round, and the second argument corresponds to the number of decimal places that we want to keep. The arguments are separated by commas.\n\nround(2.1415, 0)\n\n[1] 2\n\nround(2.1415, 2)\n\n[1] 2.14\n\n\nThe order of the arguments is important. What happens if we try to run round(2, 2.1415)? Fortunately, arguments have names that you can use to specify which data to use in each case. So, we can write\n\nround(x = 2.1415, digits = 3)\n\n[1] 2.142\n\n\nEven better, we can pass arguments in any order as long as we name them all\n\nround(digits = 3, x = 2.1415)\n\n[1] 2.142\n\n\nBut if we use the wrong name in a function, we will probably get an error message\n\nround(x = 2.1415, basket = 3)\n\nError in round(x = 2.1415, basket = 3): unused argument (basket = 3)\n\n\nA quick way to check what arguments we can use is to use another function called args, which takes the name of a function as its argument:\n\nargs(round)\n\nfunction (x, digits = 0) \nNULL\n\n\nThe output shows that round() has two arguments: x (the number we want to round) and digits. It also shows that digits is already set to zero. This means that R will use 0 as the default value. Arguments with default values are optional because we can choose to modify them or not.\nI encourage you to name all the arguments in the function, or at least the ones after the first argument. It is hard to remember all the arguments that can go into more complicated functions. And it is even harder to remember the correct order. Accidentally switching unnamed arguments can produce wrong results without us knowing. Naming the arguments will prevent errors and clarify the function’s behavior.\nThe functions we have used are simple and intuitive to use. But sometimes we need to know more before we can use a function in our code. Where can we find explanations to help us?"

    "section": "2.5 Getting help",
    "text": "2.5 Getting help\nTo access R’s built-in help information on any function simply use the help() function. For example, to open the help page for round(), we do\n\nhelp(\"round\")\n\nA shorter way of writing this is to use ? before the name of the function.\n\n?round\n\nAfter you run the code, the help page is displayed in the “Help” tab in the “Files-Plots-Packages” pane (usually in the bottom right of RStudio).\nHelp pages may seem arcane to the novice user, probably because they aim for shortness and use a lot of technical jargon. But this short jargon makes (most of) the explanations precise, so we can use the information we need without having to read the entire document. Also, all help pages are organized similarly, so we don’t have to relearn how to navigate them. So, with a bit of practice, you will be able to find exactly what you need in mere seconds.\nThe first line of the help document displays the name of the function and the package that contains the function. Other sections are:\n\nDescription: a short description of the function.\nUsage: names the arguments associated with the function and possible default values.\nArguments: expounds each argument and what they do.\nDetails: a more detailed description of the function.\nValue: if applicable, gives the type and structure of the object returned by the function or the operator.\nSee Also: leads to other help pages with similar or related content.\nExamples: code examples on how to use the function. To see how they work, we just need to copy and paste them into the console. We can also access examples at any time by using the example() function (i.e. example(\"round\")).\n\nThe help() function is useful if we know the name of the function. But if all we remember is a key word in the name, we can search through R’s help system using help.search()\n\nhelp.search(\"round\")\n\nOr we can use the shortcut ??\n\n??round\n\nAs before, the ‘Help’ tab in RStudio will display the results of the search. help.search() searches through the help documentation, code demonstrations, and package vignettes and displays the results as clickable links that we can follow.\nAnother useful function is apropos(). This function can be used to list all functions containing a specified character string. For example, to find all functions with sum in their name.\n\napropos(\"round\")\n\n[1] \"round\"        \"round.Date\"   \"round.POSIXt\"\n\n\nIf we find the function we need, we can look for its documentation.\n\nhelp(\"round.Date\")\n\nAnother useful function is RSiteSearch(), which allows us to search for keywords and phrases in function help pages and vignettes for all CRAN packages, and in CRAN task views. So, we can access the online search engine directly from the Console and display the results in our web browser.\n\nRSiteSearch(\"regression\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get started with help pages?\n\n\n\nStart by reading the help pages of functions that you already understand. This will teach you how to understand the structure of the pages and will familiarize you with the jargon. As you use R you will likely need other, more complicated functions, so reading more help pages will happen almost naturally.\nJust keep in mind that help pages are about code, not about the underlying concepts. If you don’t know what it means to round a number, reading the documentation for round() will not help you.\n\n\nNow that we know how to get help, we can move on to more advanced stuff. Previously we worked with one number at the time. But we can also work with groups of numbers by using something called “vectors”."

All the logical and mathematical functions we used before work with vectors:\n\nmy_vec &gt; 2\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nmy_vec &lt;= 7\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\nmy_vec + 7\n\n[1] 12 10 14  8  8 15\n\nmy_vec / 11\n\n[1] 0.45454545 0.27272727 0.63636364 0.09090909 0.09090909 0.72727273\n\nsqrt(my_vec)\n\n[1] 2.236068 1.732051 2.645751 1.000000 1.000000 2.828427\n\nfactorial(my_vec)\n\n[1]   120     6  5040     1     1 40320\n\nlog(my_vec)\n\n[1] 1.609438 1.098612 1.945910 0.000000 0.000000 2.079442\n\nmy_vec*my_vec\n\n[1] 25  9 49  1  1 64\n\n\nIn the last example, R did not follow the rules of linear algebra to multiply two vectors. Instead, R uses “element-wise execution”, which means that R applies the same operation to each member of the vector. For example, my_vec + 7 adds 7 to each number inside my_vec.\nWhen you use two vectors with the same number of elements for an operation, R will line up the vectors and perform a sequence of individual operations. For instance, in my_vec*my_vec, R multiplies the first element of vector 1 by the first element of vector 2, then the second element of vector 1 by the second element of vector 2, and so on, until all elements are multiplied. The result will be a new vector the same length as the first two.\nIf you give R two vectors of unequal lengths, R will repeat the shorter vector until it is as long as the longer vector, and then do the math.\n\nmy_vec * c(1, 2)\n\n[1]  5  6  7  2  1 16\n\n\nIf the length of the short vector does not divide evenly into the length of the long vector, R will do an “incomplete repeat” of the shorter vector and return a warning.\n\nmy_vec * c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nWarning in my_vec * c(1, 2, 3, 4): longer object length is not a multiple of\nshorter object length\n\n\n[1]  5  6 21  4  1 16\n\n\nRepeating the numbers of the vector is known as “vector recycling”, and it helps R do element-wise operations.\nElement-wise operations allow us to manipulate entire data variables rather than one element at a time. When you start working with data sets, element-wise operations will ensure that values from one observation or case are only paired with values from the same observation or case. Element-wise operations also make it easier to write your own programs and functions in R.\nR can also do vector and matrix multiplications, but we have to explicitly ask for them. For example, to get the inner product, we need the operator %*%:\n\nmy_vec %*% my_vec\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]  149\n\n\nAnd to get the outer product, we need %o%:\n\nmy_vec %o% my_vec\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]\n[1,]   25   15   35    5    5   40\n[2,]   15    9   21    3    3   24\n[3,]   35   21   49    7    7   56\n[4,]    5    3    7    1    1    8\n[5,]    5    3    7    1    1    8\n[6,]   40   24   56    8    8   64\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with matrix operations, don’t worry. You won’t need them in these notes.\n\n\n2.6.2 Extracting elements\nWe can access specific elements of vectors using the square bracket [ ] notation. Write the name of the vector you want to extract from, followed by a the square brackets with an index of the element you wish to extract. This index can be a position or the result of a logical test.\nTo extract elements based on their position we simply write the position inside the [ ]. Let’s first recall the values of my_vec.\n\nmy_vec\n\n[1] 5 3 7 1 1 8\n\n\nTo extract the 3rd value of my_vec, we use\n\nmy_vec[3]\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nWe can store this value in another object\n\nvalue_3 = my_vec[3]\n\nAnd we can extract multiple elements at the time by using a vector of indices inside the square brackets:\n\nmy_vec[c(1, 3, 5)]\n\n[1] 5 7 1\n\n\nOr we can use : notation. Remember that : helps us create a sequence of values. For example,\n\n3:6\n\n[1] 3 4 5 6\n\n\nSo,\n\nmy_vec[3:6]\n\n[1] 7 1 1 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn R, the positional index starts at 1, so to call the first element of a vector we need to use [1]. In most other programming languages (like Python and C++), the positional index starts at 0.\n\n\nAnother convenient way to extract elements from a vector is to use a logical expression as an index. For example, to extract all elements greater than 4 from my_vec, we do\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &gt; 4]\n\n[1] 5 7 8\n\n\nThis works because R uses element-wise operations even for logical statements. So, my_vec &gt; 4 asks if each item of my_vec meets the condition “greater than four” and returns the corresponding vector of TRUE and FALSE. Then, when we add this result to the square brackets, R examines each element of my_vec asking “should I extract this element?”. If the answer is TRUE, the value is extracted; if it’s FALSE, the value is ignored. Under the hood, my_vec &gt; 4 is equivalent to\n\nmy_vec[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]\n\n[1] 5 7 8\n\n\nThere are two useful functions to extract values of a vector. head() helps us extract the first few values of a vector.\n\nhead(my_vec, n = 3)\n\n[1] 5 3 7\n\n\ntail() gives us the last few values of a vector\n\ntail(my_vec, n = 3)\n\n[1] 1 1 8\n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Replacing elements\nWe can replace the elements of a vector by combining the square bracket notation with the assignment operator. For example, to replace the second element of my_vec, we do\n\nmy_vec[2] &lt;- 99\nmy_vec\n\n[1]  5 99  7  1  1  8\n\n\nTo replace multiple elements with the same value, say, elements 5 and 6, we do\n\nmy_vec[c(5, 6)] &lt;- 55\nmy_vec\n\n[1]  5 99  7  1 55 55\n\n\nR can also replace elements element wise:\n\nmy_vec[c(5, 6)] &lt;- c(100, 200)\nmy_vec\n\n[1]   5  99   7   1 100 200\n\n\nWhat happens if you try to replace two values with a vector that has three (or more) values?\n\nmy_vec[c(5, 6)] &lt;- c(100, 200, 500)\n\nWarning in my_vec[c(5, 6)] &lt;- c(100, 200, 500): number of items to replace is\nnot a multiple of replacement length\n\nmy_vec\n\n[1]   5  99   7   1 100 200\n\n\nLogical expressions help us replace values that meet specific conditions without having to find them ourselves.\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &gt; 44] &lt;- -1\nmy_vec\n\n[1]  5 -1  7  1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Reordering elements of vectors\nTo sort the elements of a vector from lowest to highest, we can use sort()\n\nmy_vec &lt;- sort(my_vec)\nmy_vec\n\n[1] -1 -1 -1  1  5  7\n\n\nIf we want to sort from highest to lowest, we need to set the optional argument decreasing to TRUE\n\nmy_vec &lt;- sort(my_vec, decreasing = TRUE)\nmy_vec\n\n[1]  7  5  1 -1 -1 -1\n\n\nAnother option is to first use sort() and then reverse the sorted vector using rev().\n\nmy_vec &lt;- rev(sort(my_vec))\n\nA more useful feature of vectors is that we can reorder their elements based on the values of other vectors. To show this, let’s first create a vector of countries and another vector with (my guess of) their typical daily temperatures.\n\ncountries &lt;- c(\"Japan\", \"Egypt\", \"Mexico\", \"Finland\")\ntemperatures_fahrenheit &lt;- c(50, 90, 65, -10)\n\nImagine we want to order the vector of countries, going from coldest to hottest. The first step to reorder the countries is to use order() to create a new variable called “temperatures_ordered”.\n\ntemperatures_ordered &lt;- order(temperatures_fahrenheit)\ntemperatures_ordered\n\n[1] 4 1 3 2\n\n\nThis output says that the lowest value in temperatures_fahrenheit is in the fourth position, the second lowest value is on the first position, and so on. So, we can think of temperatures_ordered as a vector of positional indices of temperatures in ascending order.\nNow we can use these indices to reorder the vector of countries.\n\ncountries_ordered &lt;- countries[temperatures_ordered]\ncountries_ordered\n\n[1] \"Finland\" \"Japan\"   \"Mexico\"  \"Egypt\"  \n\n\nTa-da!\nThese vector manipulations can do more than dazzle your friends. Imagine you have a dataset with two columns of data and you want to sort each column. If you just use sort() on each column separately, the values of each column will become uncoupled from each other. By using order() on one column, a vector of positional indices is created of the values of the column in ascending order. Then we can use this vector as the index of elements on the second column, which will return a vector of values based on the first column."

    "section": "2.8 Writing our own functions",
    "text": "2.8 Writing our own functions\nFunctions, as you may remember, are objects that store commands, which is helpful when we want to the same thing to different inputs. The three basic parts of a function are name, code to implement, and arguments. To assemble these parts, we can use the function() function (yes, really) followed by a pair of curly brackets {}:\n\nmy_function &lt;- function() {}\n\nfunction() will run the code that we write inside the curly brackets. This code is called the body of the function.\nLet’s try something simple, like adding 1 + 1:\n\nsimple_function &lt;- function() {\n    1 + 1\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndents make code more readable\n\n\n\nNote that I indented the body of the function. This indentation doesn’t affect your function, but it makes it easier to read our code because it highlights the structure of nested code.\n\n\nTo run our function, we have to write its name followed by round brackets, just like with any other function:\n\nsimple_function()\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nRemember to write the round brackets even if they are empty. The round brackets make R run the code inside the function. If we don’t write these brackets, R will show us the code inside the function (try it!).\nNow let’s write a function that will convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius. Since we want to use this function with different temperatures, we need to include an argument that will tell R which temperature to convert each time.\n\nfahrenheit_to_celsius &lt;- function(temperature) {\n    (temperature - 32) / 1.8\n}\nfahrenheit_to_celsius(27)\n\n[1] -2.777778\n\n\nNow let’s try something a bit more complicated: solving a quadratic equation. If we have an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), then the solutions are given by \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). We can write a function that will apply this formula for us.\n\nsolve_quadratic = function(a, b, c) {\n    # Quadratic equations can have two solutions\n    solution_1 = (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # First solution to equation\n    solution_2 = (-b - sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # Second solution to equation\n}\n\nDid you see the comments I added? R will ignore everything that comes after a hashtag #. This # is known in R as commenting symbol because it allows us to comment our code. This way we can explain confusing chunks of code, or warn about potential problems.\nNow all we need is to identify values of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) to pass as arguments.\n\nsolve_quadratic(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)\n\nWhy didn’t our function show a result? When we run a function, R runs the code in the body and returns the result of the last line of code. If this line doesn’t return a value, neither will our function. So, we have to write something to ensure that solve_quadratic() displays the solutions. Since we are using a script (right?) it is easy to go back to our function and just add one more line:\n\nsolve_quadratic = function(a, b, c) {\n    # Quadratic equations can have two solutions\n    solution_1 = (-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # First solution to equation\n    solution_2 = (-b - sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a # Second solution to equation\n    c(solution_1, solution_2) # Show vector of solutions\n}\nsolve_quadratic(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)\n\n[1]  2.302776 -1.302776\n\n\nNow imagine that we want to multiply the solutions to our equation by an arbitrary value (maybe because we want to convert the units of \\(x\\) to something else). And let’s pretend that, by default, we want to double the solutions. We can write another function that first calls solve_quadratic() and then multiplies the result by our arbitrary number.\n\nmultiply_solutions = function(a, b, c, multiplier = 2) {\n    solve_quadratic(a, b, c) * multiplier\n}\nmultiply_solutions(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3)\n\n[1]  4.605551 -2.605551\n\nmultiply_solutions(a = 1, b = -1, c = -3, multiplier = 10)\n\n[1]  23.02776 -13.02776\n\n\nYou can give your functions as many arguments as you like. Just list their names, separated by commas, in the parentheses that follow function. When the function runs, R will replace each argument name in the function body with the value that the user supplies for the argument. If the user does not supply a value, R will replace the argument name with the argument’s default value (if you defined one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects created in functions disappear\n\n\n\nAll of the objects that we create inside a function will disappear after it finishes running. We can only save the output of the function by assigning it to an object."

Before looking at an example of how read.table is used, let’s consider common issues that arise when reading data into any program.\n\nWhat is the file name?\nWhat is the file type?\nWhere is the file located?\nDoes the file include variable names?\nHow are fields separated (e.g., tab, comma, white-space)?\nHow are missing values stored?\n\nThe read.table function is used in R for importing text data into data set objects. This function requires that you have a valid data table in a text format (where rows are observations, and columns are variables) with every cell containing a data point. If there are any blanks, the function may not work properly. Missing values by default should be coded as NA before attempting to import text data. Columns should be separated by white space.\nThe read.table function has arguments that allow the user to control data importation features.\n&gt; help(read.table)\nThe four most important arguments to the read.table function are file, header, sep, and na.strings. Let’s practice by importing the samp2.dat text file. Be sure to first change the working directory to the folder that contains samp2.dat. In RStudio you can either use the Session &gt; Set Working Directory menu option or use the setwd() function.\n&gt; gro = read.table(\"groceries.txt\")\n&gt; head(gro)\n&gt; str(gro)\nBy passing only the file argument to read.table, we have left all other arguments at their default values.

The easiest thing to do is to first export the data into either a tab-delimited (.dat, .tsv) or comma separated values (.csv) file.

    "text": "9.4 The apply Function\nThe apply function performs a function on each row or column of a matrix. (There are other *apply functions for other situations.) First create a couple matrices to play with. In addition to the matrix function, rbind (or cbind) can be used to create matrices. For example,\n&gt; c1 = c(2, 9, 3)\n&gt; c2 = c(12, 1, 5)\n&gt; M2 = cbind(c1, c2)\n&gt; M2\n&gt; apply(M2, 2, mean)\nIn the example above, apply took three arguments:\n\nThe first argument, “M2” is the matrix\nThe second argument, “2”, is an index indicating the function is applied separately for each column, a value of “1” would apply the function on each row\nThe last argument is the function that is applied\n\nIf you were to just type mean(M2), the mean would be computed over the entire matrix.\n&gt; mean(M2)"
