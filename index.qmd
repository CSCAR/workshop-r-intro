# Preface {.unnumbered}

These self-contained notes are intended for anyone that wants to use **R** but 
has little or no experience using it, and little or no experience in programming.
Faculty and staff from "Consulting for Statistics, Computing & Analytics
Research" (CSCAR) wrote these notes to support in-person workshops at
the University of Michigan. During these workshops, we also use a slideshow 
based on these notes, which is available [here](https://cscar.github.io/workshop-r-intro/slideshow.html).

CSCAR is a unit of the Office of the Vice President of Research at the University of Michigan. We offer U-M researchers guidance and training in data collection, management, and analysis; and in the use of technical software and advanced computing in research. 

If you are a member of the faculty, professional staff, or a student at the University of Michigan, you can access our free, one-hour consultations with graduate-level statisticians. To request an appointment---which can be remote or in person---you can send an email to
<deskpeople@umich.edu>, or you can fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei-twcjFkoobUrVwSQTmSxdKKEc1Ub8w5LHmeIZUmTV1wmIg/viewform?pli=1). You can also walk-in for a consultation with one of our Graduate Student Research Assistants (GSRAs). GSRAs are available Monday through Friday, between 9am and 5pm (we close on Tuesdays between noon and 1pm).

CSCAR can also help with simple statistical questions through email. You can
write to <stats-consulting@umich.edu>.
